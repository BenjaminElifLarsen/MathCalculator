--Complex Math--
Being able to use more than two numbers.
Two ways of doing it.
  1) User enter number. Click an option (+-*/). User Enter Second Number. Result is given. User enter third number. 
    Clicks an option (+-*/). Result is done on second number and third number. Etc.
  2) User enter a string of numbers, consiting of numbers and operations. Program seperate into all numiercal values and knows
    which values belong to which operations and the order of calculations. 
      More prone to errors. 
      But more of a challenge. 

Gone with option 1. Addition and subtraction are slightly off. Result - 2.1 will sometimes alter a different decimal.
