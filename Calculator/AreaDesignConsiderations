Circle: 1 variable.
Trapezoid: 3 variables.
Polygon: 2 variables.
Cone: 2 variables. 

Considerations: 
  1) HAve a single textbox the user can enter values into. Textbox next to it states what the variable is. When a variable 
    has been entered a button has been clicked, ask for next variable. 
    Maybe use a dropdown menu for select one of the different kinds of shapes.
